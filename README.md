I made some changes to make the game more fun and straightforward:
  1. Player's ships are marked as 'S';
  2. Computer's ships are invisiable;
  3. Player's ships would be marked as 'X' if sunk;
  4. Computer's ship would appear as '~' if it is sunk by the player ot computer itself
  5. The place without ship hitted by the player would be marked as '-', while hitted by computer would not
  6. Computer is not programmed smartly that it would avoid the place it hit before, so you are more likely to win
  
Enjoy the game!
